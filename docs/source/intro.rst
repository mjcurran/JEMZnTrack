Introduction
============

The following documentation is meant to be a general guideline for creating and managing machine learning
projects for the Notre Dame Center for Research Computing.  

The main framework we'll be discussing is based on python, dvc, Jupyter, and ZnTrack.

`Python <https://www.python.org>`_ is a high-level programming language with many modules available to help with data processing,
as well as neural networks and other machine learning models.

`DVC <https://dvc.org>`_ is a language independent data and workflow management which helps consolidate your experiment stages
and version the outputs.

`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ provides a cell based python editor, useful for prototyping code, or even running full experiments.

`ZnTrack <https://github.com/zincware/ZnTrack>`_ is a python module made by Zincware which allows the use of DVC from within python code, 
especially when using a jupyter-notebook.
